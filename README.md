This code defines a custom hook called `useMediaQuery` that helps determine whether a given CSS media query matches and returns a boolean value.

Here's how the code works:

1. The function takes a single argument `queryValue`, which is a string representing the CSS media query to match.
2. Inside the hook, it declares a state variable called `match`, initialized to `false` using `useState`.
3. It then defines an effect hook using `useEffect` which:
   1. Defines a variable `isMounted` and sets it to true. This will be used later to prevent memory leaks.
   2. Uses `window.matchMedia` to create a media query object based on the `queryValue`.
   3. Defines a function called `handleChange` that checks whether the component is still mounted before updating its state via `setMatch(!!matchMedia.matches)`. Like the previous example, it uses `!!` to coerce the result into a boolean value.
   4. Registers `handleChange` as an event listener for the `change` event of the `matchMedia` object, so that it can listen for changes to the media query.
   5. Calls `setMatch(!!matchMedia.matches)` outside of the `handleChange` function to set the initial state of the component without waiting for any updates.
   6. Returns a cleanup function that sets `isMounted` to `false` and removes the `handleChange` function as an event listener from the `matchMedia` object when the component unmounts.
4. Finally, the `useMediaQuery` hook returns the boolean `match`.

Essentially, this hook subscribes to changes in the media query specified by `queryValue`, and returns a `true` or `false` value depending on whether the query currently matches. If the query changes later due to those changes, the hook will update its state and return a new value.
