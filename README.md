This code defines a custom hook called `useMediaQuery` that helps determine whether a given CSS media query matches and returns a boolean value.

Here's how the code works:

1. The function takes a single argument `queryValue`, which is a string representing the CSS media query to match.
2. Inside the hook, it declares a state variable called `match`, initialized to `false` using `useState`.
3. It then defines an effect hook using `useEffect` which:
   1. Defines a variable `isMounted` and sets it to true. This will be used later to prevent memory leaks.
   2. Uses `window.matchMedia` to create a media query object based on the `queryValue`.
   3. Defines a function called `handleChange` that checks whether the component is still mounted before updating its state via `setMatch(!!matchMedia.matches)`. Like the previous example, it uses `!!` to coerce the result into a boolean value.
   4. Registers `handleChange` as an event listener for the `change` event of the `matchMedia` object, so that it can listen for changes to the media query.
   5. Calls `setMatch(!!matchMedia.matches)` outside of the `handleChange` function to set the initial state of the component without waiting for any updates.
   6. Returns a cleanup function that sets `isMounted` to `false` and removes the `handleChange` function as an event listener from the `matchMedia` object when the component unmounts.
4. Finally, the `useMediaQuery` hook returns the boolean `match`.

Essentially, this hook subscribes to changes in the media query specified by `queryValue`, and returns a `true` or `false` value depending on whether the query currently matches. If the query changes later due to those changes, the hook will update its state and return a new value.


You can use the `useMediaQuery` hook simply by importing it into your React component and invoking it with a CSS media query. 

Here's an example of how you could use this hook:

```
import React from 'react';
import useMediaQuery from './useMediaQuery';

function MyComponent() {

  const isSmallScreen = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');

  return (
    <div>
      {isSmallScreen && <p>This is a smaller screen!</p>}
      {!isSmallScreen && <p>This is not a smaller screen!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we are passing in the media query string `(max-width: 768px)` to check if we are on a smaller screen (like a mobile device). We then render different paragraphs based on whether the `isSmallScreen` value returned from the hook is `true` or `false`.

You can replace the media query string with whatever CSS media query you need for your application. This hook can be useful for handling responsive design logic in your React components.
